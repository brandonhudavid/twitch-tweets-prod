<!-- ABOUT -->
## What is Twitch Tweets?

Twitch Tweets is a simple game that undeniably proves how well you know your live streamers. Get a random Tweet, and guess who made the tweet from 4 of your favorite streamers. Keep guessing until you take the L.

And there are 5 hand-picked tweets from each streamer, so 40 tweets in total.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

If public reception of this game is good, I'll consider expanding the game to other live streaming subcommunities. The following is a list of streaming circles I'd like to highlight and expand this game to:

- OfflineTV
- OTK
- HololiveEN
- VShojo


<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! At the moment, I have not set up a streamlined way for others to contribute. However, I think it would be cool to clean up the code so that others could expand the game to different streaming circles via a simple Pull Request (or even a Google Form for the less tech savvy).

If you're interested in contributing, let's keep in touch! Feel free to contact me on Twitter: [@bdiddydavid](https://twitter.com/bdiddydavid)
